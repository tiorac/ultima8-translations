I've added to the Spanish translation of Ultima VIII: Pagan the tools used for
do it. I've used several tools (although they could be embedded in one unique
tool), this would be 5 tools for texts and 1 tool for graphics.


============================== TOOLS EXPLANATION ==============================

***** GRAPHIC TOOL *****

The graphic tool used is named Ultima VIII: Pagan GraFX Tool v1.0 (U8FX.EXE).
It has been developed with Microsoft Visual Basic 2010 Express (x32), and
you will need probably .NET package.

I know there are some tools for viewing several images (frames)
for U8 .FLX files, BUT, this tool allows export/import to/from .PNG files
(to edit them) AND allows also Save/Load shapes (.shp) files, the ones
we can extract/import with U8FT.EXE tool.

This tool permits:
- Read and View shapes/frames from: U8SHAPES.FLX, U8FONTS.FLX, U8GUMPS.FLX
- Import/Export to .PNG: U8FONTS.FLX, U8GUMPS.FLX (NOT COMPRESSED)
  (is possible to implement the feature for U8SHAPES, but I have not needed
   it for the Spanish translation).
- Export to .PNG ALL frames from one given shape.
- Load/Save one shape with all the frames (shape format usable with U8FT.EXE).
- Export Palette U8PAL.PAL to .GPL (gimp) format.

The tool has some more features, gives a bunch of info, tells wich color
is the pixel we select in the frame, etc...

I used the tool to export/import U8FONTS and U8GUMPS needed for the Spanish
translation.

Have in mind that when the tool is used, it is needed to tell where is
U8PAL.PAL file (I recommend put it in the same folder with U8FX Tool).
Also, when you open a .shp file (saved previously or extracted with U8FT.EXE),
you will need to tell to the tool which type is (FONT, GUMP or SHAPE), if it
is not correct, the tool will not understand what is reading.


***** TRANSLATION TOOLS *****

For my purposes I've decided to create 5 Tools with
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express (x32):

1.) U8FT.EXE Tool
This is a .FLX extractor/creator. I've used it with U8GUMPS.FLX, U8FONTS.FLX,
U8SHAPES.FLX, EUSECODE.FLX and E44.FLX...E666.FLX flex files.

When this tool is used it creates a "index.txt" file. This file is needed when
creating again a new FLX file. Executing the tool will give to you the options
or parameters you can use. This file is ALSO needed FOR THE NEXT tools.

*If we extract from EUSECODE.FLX the result files has .cls extension (class).
*If we extract from U8GUMPS.FLX, U8FONTS.FLX or U8SHAPES.FLX the result
 files has .shp extension (shape).
*If we extract from E44.FLX... E666.FLX the result files has .u8c extension.


2.) U8DEC.EXE Tool
This tool is used to decode or decompile the text part and needed instructions
for do the translation. It should be used in one of the clases EUSECODE.FLX
flex file has (except in 0000.cls and 0001.cls, globals and names classes).


3.) U8CALC.EXE Tool
This tool is used to calculate o recalculate the offsets, addresses or other
things in a class that has been translated (and extracted previously with
U8DEC.EXE)

This tool also replaces some foreign characters:
- In Spanish: 'á' 'é' 'í' 'ó' 'ú' 'ñ' 'ü' 'Á' 'É' 'Í' 'Ó' 'Ú' 'Ñ' 'Ü' '¡' '¿'
having in mind the file "table.txt". See the one added in the package to
have a sample of the format. (HEXCODE_FONTFRAME=<real character of language>)
"HEXCODE_FONTFRAME" would be the hex position in U8FONTS.FLX of the font.
Fonts used in Spanish translation:
- 0000.shp(blue), 0005.shp(orange), 0006.shp(red), 0007.shp(green),
  0008.shp(yellow) -> Dialogue fonts
- 000A.shp, 000B.shp -> tombstones and plaques fonts
- 0009.shp -> Books and scrolls font


4.) U8COMP.EXE Tool
This tool is used to encode or compile translated and recalculated class
into a new .cls usable and ready to add into EUSECODE.FLX file.
To compile one class it is needed the ORIGINAL ENGLISH class file.


5.) U8Q.EXE Tool
This tool unencrypts or encrypts ECREDITS.DAT and QUOTES.DAT to modify
it if necessary. It uses 0x0A as new line char (not 0x0D 0x0A chars
used by windows). It is necessary use special editor to edit this files.
If some 0x0D code is used for do "new line", it must be deleted.



***** ENVIRONMENT FOR TRANSLATION AND STEPS *****
Once we know the tools, maybe it is needed to explain a bit more how we
can translate for further translators. Only for EUSECODE.FLX file.
I recommend to prepare this environment (sample of folders):

/-TRANSLATION
   /-EUSECODE
       In this folder we will have original english EUSECODE.FLX and U8FT.EXE.
       We use "U8FT -x EUSECODE.FLX" and will appear a bunch of .cls files and
       one "index.txt" file.
       Copy "index.txt in" the other four folders.
       Copy all .cls files into /-DEC and /-COMP folders.     
   /-DEC
       In this folder we will have U8DEC.EXE, all .cls files and "index.txt".
       After executing "U8DEC.EXE -a" we will have the same files and a bunch
       of new .txt files with texts extracted. The same amount as .cls files,
       of course (except 0000.cls and 0001.cls).
       A sample of a .txt file (0x00B4 class in EUSECODE.FLX):
          01|0080|0080
          04|009B|0023
          02|009F|000A|Blackwine 
          03|00BE|00D6
          04|00C6|0023
          02|00CA|000A|Hurricane 
          03|00E9|00AB
          04|00F1|002A
          02|00F5|0011|Breath o' Spirit 
          03|011B|0079
          04|0123|0025
          02|0127|000C|Cloven Hoof 
          03|0148|004C       
          
       We ONLY need to translate the text part. SAMPLE:
       WARNING: Be aware of the white space(s) at the end of the texts!!!
          01|0080|0080
          04|009B|0023
          02|009F|000A|Vinoscuro 
          03|00BE|00D6
          04|00C6|0023
          02|00CA|000A|Huracán 
          03|00E9|00AB
          04|00F1|002A
          02|00F5|0011|Aliento espiritual 
          03|011B|0079
          04|0123|0025
          02|0127|000C|Pezuña hendida 
          03|0148|004C   
       
       After translating .txt files, we copy them into CALC folder.    
   /-CALC
       In this folder we will have U8CALC.EXE, "index.txt", "table.txt" and
       ALL .txt files from DEC folder translated.
       We will use "U8CALC.EXE -a" and this creates the same files with
       .new extension, with recalculated numbers and characters.
       This would be nnnn.txt.new bunch of files.
       We copy ALL this nnnn.txt.new files into COMP folder.
   /-COMP
       In this folder we will have U8COMP.EXE, "index.txt", ALL the original
       nnnn.cls files from EUSECODE folder and nnnn.txt.new files from
       CALC folder.
       After executing "U8COMP -a" we will have the text translated class
       files compiled in .cls files with .new extension.
       This would be a bunch of nnnn.cls.new files.
       We copy this nnnn.cls.new files into EUSECODE_NEW folder.
       We MUST copy also the nnnn.cls files not compiled, if any, because some
       of them are not needed to compile and maybe we decided not to add them
       to the compile process, into EUSECODE_NEW folder AND rename them as
       nnnn.cls.new file (with .new extension).
   /-EUSECODE_NEW
       In this folder we will have U8FT.EXE, "index.txt" and ALL the
       modified nnnn.cls.new files.
       Have in mind that you should change "index.txt" class names,
       this would be change "nnnn.cls" FOR "nnnn.cls.new", if not the tool
       will not read any file.
       After that, we run "U8FT -c EUSECODE.FLX.new", for example.
       Et voilà, we have here a new compiled EUSECODE with translated
       texts.


***** NOTES FOR TRANSLATIONS *****

- Not all the classes extracted from EUSECODE.FLX have text for translate
  but maybe it is needed to add them to the CALC process because maybe
  they need some recalculations.
- Normal files, like the ones with object names can be translated and
  test ingame without touch anything more.
  BUT there are files, that uses another class files that at the same time
  CALL to another class file.
  There are few, but testing ingame the translation and touching one
  of this files can make the game crash and you must begin again
  the betatesting.
  Some files I recommend to leave for the end are:
    7C, 41C, 41D, 56F, 571, 574, 57C, 581, 583, 589, 58A, 595
- Maybe it is needed to delete \GAMEDAT folder files for betatesting.
  Have it in mind.
