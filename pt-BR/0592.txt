02|01F6|04F3|EAR OF ARRICORN: VOL. III~by Kram ~~%The lone stranger slowly rode into the desolate village on the back of his mammoth, white hordax. As he dismounted his beast, he threw the leathery reins over the closest tie rod, then slowly strode to the double doors of the tavern.Though the tavern roared with the laughter of drunken herdsmen, the jovial spirit quickly flattened like fresh manure thrown against a wall. Everyone turned as the caped stranger entered the smoke filled hovel. The darkly robed individual motioned with two fingers for the stiffest grog. The tavern master quickly obeyed, pouring the thick brew with shaky hands.The women folk left, claiming they needed to visit the house of fecal waste. ~%'ShadowLander!' called a nasal tinged voice from the rear of the room, ~'Your type are not welcomed in this acre of the world.' Shortly, a path cleared between the ShadowLander and the owner of the high pitched voice. ~%The voice belonged a squat little Nobbit. He sat with a crooked smile on his smiling face while his hand played with the handle of his jeweled dagger-like sword. On his throat, just above his massive goiter, he openly wore a staff shaped tattoo. Only true herdsmen wore these. ~%A hush fell over the tavern. No one dared to draw breath.

02|070B|04E1|EAR OF ARRICORN: Vol. IV~by Kram ~~%The lone stranger turned towards the herdsman, still quaffing his grog. A bloodshot eye stared out from under his dark mask. A nervous twitch pulled at the muscle of his leathery cheek. ~%'Ha!' laughed the herdsman as he waddled up to the bar, 'I do not believe the tall tales told of the ShadowLanders'. I believe them to be lies! I think they have less than half the warrior's blood that flows through my little toe!' The Nobbit snorted at his own remark, but looked disappointed when the others did not laugh with him. ~%He turned back and stared at the stranger straight in the knee. 'For those who do not believe this, I will prove it by shedding some yellow DarkLander blood!' Quickly, he drew his great dagger-like sword. ~%Before the Nobbit could strike, the stranger grabbed the herdsman by the tattoo, and easily lifted him into the air. As the Nobbit began to open his mouth to cry out, the DarkLander shoved his massive fist down the herdsman's gullet.  The stranger took a quick pull, and turned the Nobbit in-side-out. He dropped the bloody mess on the bar. ~%Upon seeing this, some one gave the ancient herdsman warning cry; ~'Let us move the flock out of here!' ~%The tavern was instantly cleared.

02|0C0E|06A7|EAR OF ARRICORN: VOL. VI~by Kram ~~%The lone stranger dismounted from his mammoth hordax, shaking the heavy drops from his cloak. The cave he had entered was small, its capacity barely providing shelter for his beast from the deluge that poured from the angry sky outside. He ventured deeper into the cavern to find room enough to remove his rain soaked garments. ~%Stepping through a stony portal, he found himself suddenly bathed in the warm glow of a tallow fed lantern. Upon his entry into the cave seven pairs of shocked eyes turned in his direction. ~'Argh! A thief is here to take our gems!' cried one of the little men as he thrust his shovel in the stranger's direction. 'You try it, and I'll cut your eyes out and feed them to the snails!' ~%'Hold your blade, you grumpy old fool!' called one of the others, 'this nice man might be here to help us.' ~%'Nice man?' retorted the other, 'If you were not such a dopey twit you would recognize him as a ShadowLander. He helps no one but himself.' ~%'What shall we do, Doc?' call one of the others, too bashful to show his face in the light. ~%The small man who appeared to be in charge stepped forward to size up the stranger. 'Well, judging from all that trouble we had with that female a while back, I'd say we could save ourselves a pack of trouble and just put a pick up side his head right now!' ~%Suddenly, six shadowy figures leapt forwards. In a flash, the lone stranger's dark blade appeared in his hands. Quietly, it whistled through calm air, practicing its deadly craft. In the blink of an eye, six small heads fell cleft from six small frames. ~%The last midget, the one slowest in wit, made a tasty morsel for the stranger's hordax...

These range from the man-sized Monster Brown Cap all the way down to the finger-sized yellow and red Silent Sleeper. ~%Most mushrooms are edible.

He swore cheese was his meal till the day that he died. ~~His father, a strong man who was hearty and pink, was at his wits end, and driven to drink. ~He would stay at the tavern, and tell of his woe, on cheap tankards of grog his money he'd blow. ~~'My son, a good lad, though a little bit chunky, has turned into a ravenous limburger junky!' ~'All my land and my house and the coins in my purse, I will give to the man who can remove this foul curse!' ~~The old man's plea went out and was told near and far, it was whispered by gossips, and made light of in the bar. ~But one day into town strolled a strange little fellow, his robes were all tattered, and his skin a sickly yellow.~~'I can cure your boy!' he told the ripe drunken sod, 'I will make him good as new, this lad you call Todd.' ~The father cried, 'His names not Todd! It's Jelly, you snot! But go on and give it a try... Give it your best shot.' ~~But before he started, the mage asked for first, for a small taste of grog, to quell a quick thirst. ~After slamming four tankards he got back to work, though his eyes did spin, and his hands did jerk. ~~With the boy before him, the mage reared back, while clutching his reagents in a small toad sack. ~He sent out flames of red, green and blue that engulfed the boy, hiding him from all's view. ~~When the flames died away, as well as the stench, To the father's red eyes, his boy-Was a wench! ~'Oh no!' he cried, and he cursed this new fate, 'My hard working boy now looks like dungeon bait!' ~~'How could you do this, you dottering old fool! Did you sleep every day while in wizardry school?' ~With the excitement now over, the father settled down, upon the nearest table, his head he did pound.~~Suddenly, a dark robed figure entered into the grog joint, and at the old mage a withered finger he did point. ~Then with a flash of yellow, the mage disappeared, Everyone dove for cover, for spellcasters they now feared. ~~With an incantation shouted by the figure in black the young boy named Jelly quickly transmuted back. ~As he left the place everyone heard the words of the monk, 'Never let a bad spell caster cast spells, especially drunk!' ~~To this very day the young boy they call Jelly, continues to stuff away cheese in his portly pot belly. ~But his father is content, and he will always smile, 'This beats worrying about a daughter by a country mile.' ~~'Tis not that I don't want a girl,' claims the tired old father, 'But when a boy is young, he is less of a bother.'

To whoever is of sound heart and steady of sword, the riches, and the dangers, await you in the hull of a frozen ship. A ship that has sailed off into, the zone of twilight.
