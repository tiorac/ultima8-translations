02|23D4|001D|Tell me again of this place. 
03|2400|0023
02|2403|0014|What is this place? 
04|2430|0025
02|2433|0016|Tell me of the tests. 
04|245D|0028
02|2460|0019|I wish to learn to heal. 
04|24A7|001F
02|24AA|0010|I need healing.

04|24F2|00D2
02|24F6|008B|Excellent. Let me be one of the first to offer congradulations on your accomplishments here. We are all quite proud of what you have done. 
02|2598|001F|I have heard the Mystic Voice. 
03|25C4|59CE
02|25C9|001B|I have the Breath of Wind. 
04|25E9|00F5
02|25ED|009F|Yes, I suspected as much. But since you have done such a terrible thing, leaving all of us powerless, you must excuse me if I do not offer my thanks. Goodbye! 
02|26A3|001B|I have the Breath of Wind. 
06|26CE|057C:1090
03|26DB|58EC
03|26DE|58B4
02|26E3|0013|I found this ring. 
04|26FB|00A7
02|26FF|0057|Yes, that was Torwin's ring. He said it belonged to his father. Where did you find it? 
02|276B|000E|the monastery 
02|277D|000A|the woods 
02|278B|000C|Windy Point

02|27A7|000E|the monastery 
02|27BC|000A|the woods 
04|27CC|0163
02|27D0|00CF|Funny that Torwin should lose it there. He was very proud of it, said it meant the world to him. You know, I think it should be returned to his mother. I'm sure she would appreciate this memento of her son. 
02|28B6|000E|the monastery 
02|28C8|000A|the woods 
02|28D6|000C|Windy Point 
02|28EF|0012|I will return it. 
02|2905|001B|I don't wish to return it. 
03|292F|5663
02|2934|000C|Windy Point 
04|2945|0169
02|2949|00D5|Oh dear. In his haste to end his life, he must have lost it. It is a terrible tragedy, you know. He was very proud of that ring and I'm sure he would want his mother to have it. Perhaps you should take it to her.

02|2A47|000A|the woods

03|2AAE|54E4
02|2AB3|0012|I will return it. 
04|2ACA|0133
02|2ACE|00C7|That is a good thing. His mother's name is Rhian and she lives in Tenebrae. She is a weaver and, since the death of her husband, has taken over the running of the shop. Thank you for this good deed. 
02|2BAC|0012|I will return it. 
02|2BC2|001B|I don't wish to return it.

03|2BFD|5395
02|2C02|001B|I don't wish to return it. 
04|2C22|0116
02|2C26|00B1|What? That is a cruel and selfish thing to say! You must return it. You were the last one to see her son alive! I can not believe you would turn your back on someone like this! 
02|2CEE|001B|I don't wish to return it. 
02|2D18|0014|I said I would not! 
03|2D38|525A
02|2D3D|0014|I said I would not! 
04|2D56|0091
02|2D5A|005F|Have you learned nothing during your stay here?! You are an insult to this isle, leave me now!

02|2DFE|0047|Yes, this is a place of healing. Do you require my skills as a healer? 
02|2E60|0015|Yes, I need healing. 
02|2E79|001A|No, I don't need healing. 
02|2EA4|0009|Healing? 
03|2EBA|50D8
02|2EBF|0015|Yes, I need healing. 
02|2EDB|0010|I need healing. 
04|2EF1|0441
04|2EF8|0094
02|2EFC|006B|I am sorry, but I do not have the strength to perform such a service. Come back later after I have rested. 
06|2F7F|057C:1090
03|2F8C|503B
04|2F93|00D7
02|2F97|008F|I would that I could heal you, but a terrible thing has happened. I am not able to touch Stratos. I am afraid something dreadful has happened. 
02|303D|0021|I have taken the Breath of Wind. 
03|306A|0268
04|3071|0153
04|308E|00DC
02|3092|0061|Now that my Focus has been returned to me, I will be able to perform the healing rites upon you. 
06|310D|0596:0BEB
02|311D|0025|Please leave me now, I need to rest. 
06|315A|057C:1090
03|3167|4E60
03|316A|005A
02|316E|0031|I would heal you, but you are perfectly healthy! 
06|31B7|057C:1090
03|31C4|4E03
04|31CC|0106
04|31E9|00A2
02|31ED|0021|Certainly, I will do what I can. 
06|3228|0596:0BEB
02|323E|0025|Please leave me now, I need to rest. 
06|327B|057C:1090
03|3288|4D3F
03|328B|0047
02|328F|0031|I would heal you, but you are perfectly healthy! 
02|32D7|0015|Yes, I need healing. 
02|32F0|001A|No, I don't need healing. 
02|330E|0017|Hello, Brother Xavier. 
03|3332|4C60
02|3337|001A|No, I don't need healing. 
04|3356|00A8
02|335A|002A|Oh, it is pleased I am that you are well. 
02|339B|0015|Yes, I need healing. 
02|33B4|001A|No, I don't need healing. 
02|33DB|0014|What is this place? 
03|33FE|4B94
02|3403|0019|I wish to learn to heal. 
04|3421|008A
02|3425|002D|Then to do this you must become enlightened. 
02|3469|0019|I wish to learn to heal. 
02|348F|000D|Enlightened? 
03|34AB|4AE7
02|34B0|0021|I have taken the Breath of Wind. 
04|34D6|0105
02|34DA|00A3|Oh no! How can you do this? I misread your character, I did not know you for such a power hungry thief! The cost of your folly will be in untold numbers of lives. 
02|3594|0021|I have taken the Breath of Wind. 
06|35CB|057C:1090
03|35D8|49EF
03|35DB|49B7
02|35E0|0014|What is this place? 
02|35FB|001D|Tell me again of this place. 
04|361E|00F7
02|3628|005A|This is Argentrock Isle. It is home to those that follow the Great Titan of Air, Stratos. 
02|3699|0014|What is this place? 
02|36B1|001D|Tell me again of this place. 
02|36DB|0010|Who is Stratos? 
02|36EF|0017|Who are the followers? 
03|3715|487D
02|371A|0017|Who are the followers? 
04|3736|00C6
02|373A|0087|We are the Theurgists. By devoting our lives to Stratos, we are able to touch a small portion of the Titan's power and use it to heal. 
02|37D8|0017|Who are the followers? 
03|37FC|4796
02|3801|0010|Who is Stratos? 
04|3816|00AD
02|381A|0054|Stratos is the greatest of the Titans, worthy of the respect and admiration of all. 
02|3885|0013|Worthy of respect? 
02|38A6|0010|Who is Stratos? 
03|38C3|46CF
02|38C8|0013|Worthy of respect? 
04|38E0|00CF
02|38E4|0061|Yes, even for one such as you, who is obviously not enlightened, Stratos can offer great things. 
02|395C|0013|Worthy of respect? 
02|397C|000D|Enlightened? 
02|398D|0013|What great things? 
03|39AF|45E3
02|39B4|0013|What great things? 
04|39CC|00F3
02|39D0|00B8|Stratos is the greatest of the Titans. Only through her can one achieve the ability to heal the sick and injured. This gift, the power to heal is the greatest gift anyone can receive. 
02|3A9F|0013|What great things? 
03|3ABF|44D3
02|3AC4|000D|Enlightened? 
04|3AD6|0304
04|3ADD|0207
04|3AE4|00F8
02|3AE8|0005|Yes, 
02|3AF7|00BC| you should know as you are well on your way to enlightenment. You now should seek out Stellos. It is he who can teach you the spells you will need to know in order to reach enlightenment.
06|3BCC|057C:1090
03|3BD9|43EE
03|3BDC|0105
02|3BE0|0005|Yes, 
02|3BEF|006D|. Your next step in achieving enlightenment is to pass the Test of Centeredness. Are you ready for this test?
02|3C74|000D|Enlightened? 
02|3C90|0020|I am ready for the second test. 
02|3CB4|0024|I am not ready for the second test. 
03|3CE4|00F3
02|3CE8|0080|You are not of our order and have not heard the Mystic Voice of Stratos. Once you have heard the voice, you become enlightened. 
02|3D7F|000D|Enlightened? 
02|3D99|0015|I wish enlightenment 
02|3DB2|001D|I do not wish enlightenment. 
03|3DDA|41B8
02|3DDF|0020|I am ready for the second test. 
04|3E04|0041
02|3E08|0015|Then we shall begin. 
06|3E35|057C:1090
03|3E42|4185
03|3E45|414D
02|3E4A|0024|I am not ready for the second test. 
04|3E73|004C
02|3E77|0020|Then return when you are ready. 
06|3EAF|057C:1090
03|3EBC|410B
03|3EBF|40D3
02|3EC4|0015|I wish enlightenment 
04|3EDE|0126
02|3EE2|0068|This is a noble cause. I hope you have the mettle for it. The tests to gain enlightenment are fearsome. 
02|3F61|0015|I wish enlightenment 
02|3F7A|001D|I do not wish enlightenment. 
02|3FA4|0016|Tell me of the tests. 
02|3FBE|0018|You question my mettle? 
02|3FDA|001F|What makes the tests fearsome? 
03|4004|3F8E
02|4009|001D|I do not wish enlightenment. 
04|402B|00EB
02|402F|00A0|That is too bad, I think you might have the strength of character to pass the tests. But if you have not the desire, then I guess it is for the best after all. 
02|40E6|001D|I do not wish enlightenment. 
03|4116|3E7C
02|411B|0018|You question my mettle? 
04|4138|00DB
02|413C|009B|I simply mean that these tests are not for the faint of heart. Only one strong in his faith to Stratos may find the strengh of heart to survive the tests. 
02|41EE|0018|You question my mettle? 
03|4213|3D7F
02|4218|001F|What makes the tests fearsome? 
04|423C|0096
02|4240|004F|The tests are quite dangerous. We have lost more than a few initiates to them. 
02|42A6|001F|What makes the tests fearsome? 
03|42D2|3CC0
02|42D7|0016|Tell me of the tests. 
04|42F2|0113
02|42F6|00A7|It is good to see you are interested. I am responsible for administering the first two tests. The first is the Test Of Wisdom. The second is the Test of Centeredness. 
02|43B2|001F|Tell me of the Test of Wisdom. 
02|43D5|0025|Tell me of the Test of Centeredness. 
03|4405|3B8D
02|440A|001F|Tell me of the Test of Wisdom. 
04|442E|0202
02|4432|01A4|The Test of Wisdom is the first test you may take in your journey for enlightenment. This test consists of five questions which I shall ask you. These questions will test your knowledge of the ways of the Theurgists. You must answer all five correctly to pass the test. If you are thinking of taking this test, I strongly suggest you spend some time studying in the monastery's library. Do you still wish enlightenment? 
02|45ED|001F|Tell me of the Test of Wisdom. 
02|4619|0004|aye 
02|4621|0004|nay 
03|4630|3962
02|4635|0025|Tell me of the Test of Centeredness. 
04|465F|028C
04|4666|00FA
02|466A|002D|You have taken and passed this test already, 
02|46A1|008C|. I do not appreciate the lightness with which you treat these rituals! If you do not know what to do next, you should consult with Stellos.
02|4743|0012|Where is Stellos? 
03|4760|0188
02|4764|00CA|The Test of Centeredness is the second test you may take on your quest for enlightenment. During this test you will find yourself on a high rock. The winds will test your strength, balance and courage. 
02|4845|0025|Tell me of the Test of Centeredness. 
04|487E|0037
02|4883|0026|I will take the Test of Centeredness. 
03|48B5|0033
02|48BA|0025|May I take the Test of Centeredness? 
03|48EB|36A7
02|48F0|0026|I will take the Test of Centeredness. 
04|491B|00CC
02|491F|0050|Before you can take the Test of Centeredness, you must pass the Test of Wisdom. 
02|4986|0026|I will take the Test of Centeredness. 
02|49B9|001F|Tell me of the Test of Wisdom. 
03|49E7|35AB
02|49EC|0025|May I take the Test of Centeredness? 
04|4A16|02E9
04|4A1E|01AE
02|4A22|014E|Yes, I think perhaps you are ready. To take the Test of Centeredness you must travel to Windy Point and climb the highest rock there. Once atop the rock, Stratos will begin her testing of you. Her winds will blow you but you must stay atop the rock, for to fall can mean almost sure disablement and possibly death. Good luck, friend. 
02|4B87|0025|May I take the Test of Centeredness? 
06|4BBC|057C:1090
03|4BC9|33FE
03|4BCC|0130
02|4BD0|0107|I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you have already passed the Test of Centeredness and the Test of Wisdom. There is no need for you to take them again. Perhaps you should speak to Stellos now. He can continue to give you guidance in your quest for enlightenment. 
06|4CEF|057C:1090
03|4CFC|32CB
03|4CFF|3293
02|4D04|002A|May I try the Test of Centeredness again? 
04|4D33|0089
02|4D37|005D|Certainly, you may try it until you succeed. Don't worry. Many don't pass it the first time. 
06|4DAC|057C:1090
03|4DB9|320E
03|4DBC|31D6
02|4DC1|0004|aye 
04|4DCA|0194
02|4DCE|00FD|That's it, that's the spirit! You have some backbone after all. You are the second in recent times to come for enlightenment. I will ask you five questions. If you can answer all of them right, you may pass to the next test. Do you wish me to continue? 
02|4EE2|0004|aye 
02|4EEA|0004|nay 
02|4EFB|001D|I am ready, please continue. 
02|4F1C|0014|I am not yet ready.

02|4F63|0014|I am not yet ready. 
04|4F7C|0062
02|4F86|0030|Then when you feel you are ready, return to me.

02|4FE3|001D|I am ready, please continue. 
02|5007|0024|May I try the Test of Wisdom again? 
04|5031|0108
02|5035|0083|Very well then. I will begin your testing by asking you five questions. If you miss any of them, you fail the test. Do you accept? 
02|50CF|001D|I am ready, please continue. 
02|50F0|0010|I am not ready. 
02|510D|000F|Yes, I accept. 
02|5120|000E|No, I do not. 
03|5139|2E59
02|513E|000E|No, I do not. 
04|5151|00EE
02|5155|00C2|I understand, it is a bit daunting, I know. Perhaps you would feel more confident if you spent some time in the library. There you will find many texts which may make the Test of Wisdom easier. 
06|522F|057C:1090

03|6512|1A80
02|6517|001F|Another wishing enlightenment? 
04|653B|00DA
04|6542|003C
02|6546|0023|Yes. Torwin was... before he died. 
03|657E|0066
02|6582|0050|Yes, a young man named Torwin. He is an ambitious student, a very fast learner. 
02|65E9|001F|Another wishing enlightenment? 
03|6615|197D
02|661A|0022|I have completed both your tests. 
02|6643|0021|I have	completed the Third Test. 
04|666A|0285
04|6671|0102
02|6675|006F|Wonderful, I am most pleased for you! You have now earned the right to wear the title 'Initiate'. So, Initiate 
02|66EE|006F|, now you must find the Honorable Stellos. He will guide you in the next step on your journey to enlightenment.
03|6773|00F4
02|6777|00DE|Wonderful, I am most pleased for you! You have now earned the right to wear the title 'Initiate'. So, Initiate, now you must find the Honorable Stellos. He will guide you in the next step on your journey to enlightenment. 
02|686C|0022|I have completed both your tests. 
02|6892|0021|I have completed the Third Test. 
02|68C0|0020|Where is the Honorable Stellos? 
03|68EF|16A3
02|68F4|001E|I have passed the Third Test. 
04|6917|015C
04|691E|0031
02|6922|0018|That is excellent news. 
03|694F|00F4
02|6953|00C0|Huh? Were you speaking to me? Oh, I am so sorry. You passed the Third Test, you say? Well that is very good. Now, if you'll excuse me, something dreadful has happened and I must attend to it. 
02|6A28|0013|What has happened? 
02|6A48|001E|I have passed the Third Test. 
03|6A73|151F
02|6A78|0013|What has happened? 
04|6A90|0093
02|6A94|0038|Well, if you must know, my Focus of healing is missing. 
02|6AE3|0013|What has happened? 
02|6B05|0012|Focus is missing? 
03|6B23|146F
02|6B28|0012|Focus is missing? 
04|6B3F|00BF
02|6B43|0062|Yes, it is missing. What a tragic mishap. I hope I have just mislaid it, but I fear it is stolen. 
02|6BBC|0012|Focus is missing? 
02|6BDB|000C|mislaid it? 
02|6BEB|0008|stolen? 
03|6BFE|1394
02|6C03|000C|mislaid it? 
04|6C14|008C
02|6C18|0058|I cannot imagine I simply lost it. It is far too important to me for such an oversight. 
02|6C87|000C|mislaid it? 
03|6CA0|12F2
02|6CA5|0008|stolen? 
04|6CB2|0108
02|6CB6|0098|If it was, indeed, stolen, it is a tragedy beyond belief. Theft goes against all of Stratos' doctrine. It goes against all we have tried to teach here. 
02|6D65|0008|stolen? 
02|6D71|000C|mislaid it? 
02|6D8C|0022|When did you last see your Focus? 
03|6DBA|11D8
02|6DBF|0022|When did you last see your Focus? 
04|6DE6|01CA
02|6DEA|0159|It was only a night ago. I worked very late that night. When I went to bed, I laid my Focus on the chest in my bedroom, just like I always do. When I awoke in the morning, the Focus of healing was gone. Now, I am a very light sleeper. The person who took it must be able to move virtually silently, for the slightest noise would have awoken me. 
02|6F5A|0022|When did you last see your Focus? 
02|6F8B|0019|Do you know who took it? 
03|6FB0|0FE2
02|6FB5|0019|Do you know who took it? 
04|6FD3|00E2
02|6FD7|00A1|That's ridiculous! If I knew who took it, I would go get it back! Fortunately, there are spells provided by Stratos that will help me learn what happened to it. 
02|708F|0019|Do you know who took it? 
03|70B5|0EDD
02|70BA|0013|I have met Torwin. 
04|70D2|012B
04|70D9|0039
02|70DD|0020|Yes. His death is quite tragic. 
03|7112|00C6
02|7116|0080|Strange young man. For a while, I thought quite highly of him. Until you arrived, he was the best student we'd ever had. But... 
02|71AB|0013|Strange young man? 
02|71C2|000E|Best student? 
02|71DD|0013|I have met Torwin. 
03|71FD|0D95
02|7202|0013|Strange young man? 
04|721A|0157
02|721E|00FA|He was always unusual. We often find him standing in the shadows outside different houses. What he is doing, we can only guess. When confronted, he offers no explanation, just wanders off. He has recently taken an interest in the Resurrection spell. 
02|732F|0013|Strange young man? 
02|7351|0014|Resurrection spell? 
03|7371|0C21
02|7376|0014|Resurrection spell? 
04|738F|00B7
02|7393|0055|Yes, it is possible to bring the dead back to life if the proper conditions are met. 
02|73FF|0014|Resurrection spell? 
02|7422|0018|What proper conditions? 
03|7446|0B4C
02|744B|0018|What proper conditions? 
04|7468|0118
02|746C|00B9|It will cost you your eyesight. This is why Stellos is blind. Because of this high price, Stratos only gives that spell to one Adept at a time. It is, afterall, a very dangerous spell. 
02|753C|0018|What proper conditions? 
02|7563|0011|Dangerous spell? 
03|7580|0A12
02|7585|0011|Dangerous spell? 
04|759B|00E6
02|759F|00AD|Most certainy, for to cast it, one must journey to the City of the Dead and face the minions of Lithos. More than one caster in our history has not survived that encounter. 
02|7663|0011|Dangerous spell? 
03|7681|0911
02|7686|000E|Best student? 
04|7699|015A
04|76A6|002F
02|76AA|0016|Well, before he died. 
03|76D5|011B
02|76D9|00E8|Well, he was until he reached the Third Test. For some reason he could not pass it. He has tried a number of times. I have heard he is trying to find a way to reach Stratos and hear the Mystic Voice without passing that third test. 
02|77D8|000E|Best student? 
03|77F3|079F
02|77F8|001B|How terrible about Torwin. 
04|7818|006D
02|781C|002A|It is said that pride goes before a fall. 
02|785D|001B|How terrible about Torwin. 
03|7885|070D
02|788A|0018|I have met Holy Cyrrus. 
04|78A7|0435
04|78AE|0218
04|78B5|016E
02|78B9|012E|He is a nice young man. (I think he is soft and a bit of a sissy.) I have high hopes for his abilities. (He will never make it as an Adept. I bet he's back to his torax in a month.) He and Torwin were very good friends. (I think they spent too much time together and not enough time on their studies.) 
02|79FE|0018|I have met Holy Cyrrus. 
03|7A23|00A0
02|7A27|0063|He is a nice young man. I have high hopes for his abilities. He and Torwin were very good friends. 
02|7AA1|0018|I have met Holy Cyrrus. 
03|7AC6|0213
04|7ACD|016D
02|7AD1|012D|He is a nice young man. (I think he is soft and a bit of a sissy.) I have high hopes for his abilities. (He will never make it as an Adept. I bet he's back to his torax in a month.)

02|7C15|0018|I have met Holy Cyrrus. 
03|7C3A|009F
02|7C3E|0062|He is a nice young man. I have high hopes for his abilities. He and Torwin are very good friends. 
02|7CB7|0018|I have met Holy Cyrrus. 
03|7CDC|02B6
02|7CE1|0022|I have met the Honorable Stellos. 
04|7D08|00AB
02|7D0C|0061|What a wonderful man. I only hope to aspire to the knowledge he has gained during his long life. 
02|7D84|0022|I have met the Honorable Stellos. 
03|7DB3|01DF
02|7DB8|0004|bye 
04|7DC1|0040
02|7DC5|0014|Be well, my friend. 
06|7DF1|057C:1090
03|7DFE|01C9
03|7E01|0191
02|7E06|0024|I have found your Focus of healing! 
04|7E2F|0163
05|7E3D|0581:20B8
04|7E45|00A1
02|7E49|007C|How wonderful! Thank you, my friend. There is no way I can repay this debt, but should you need healing, please come to me. 
03|7EE6|0096
02|7EEA|0020|What? You do not have my Focus! 
02|7F20|004A|Do not toy with me with matters like that! I must have my focus returned! 
06|7F82|057C:1090
03|7F8F|0038
03|7F95|A08C
02|7F99|0009|Goodbye! 
06|7FBA|057C:1090
